	    <font size="5">We designed a game, Craps, on Canpoy but it could not run Canopy code on this website so we converted it to repl.it. All you have to do press run, wait a litle for it to load, then follow the instructions and type in what it says. Enjoy!</font> <br>

  <font size="5">Here you can see I minipulated an image of a dog. I first changed it to have a blue backround, then I made the dog blue and kept the backround black. Lastly I made the backround white! Below you will see the code we used in changing the image</font>

	   <font size="5">Here we asked the question, "What percentage of the total population does each grade consume in an average highschool?" We found out that freshaman are aroud 22.7%, sophmores are around 27.7%, juniors are around 26.8%, and seniors are around 22.8%. We chose this type of graph, the pie chart, to easily display the way a highschool is broken up into different groups. </font>

	   <font size="5">We made two populations of bugs with high reproductive potential but the population of bugs on the right can survive much longer for less energy compared to the population on the left. Then in the top right image, we see the bugs on the right can have a much larger population without needing to consume as much food as the population on the right.In the bottom left image, we will restart the simulation but this time at 250 ticks I will add a disease to both populations. Lastly, the bottom right image, the population on the right was on average, able to hold a higher population than the population on the left, but the disease in the population on the left eventually died out. The population on the right was stuck with a population of infected bugs.</font>
